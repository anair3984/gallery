	  <h1>Extra</h1>
	  <p><img src="work.png" width="250" height="142" alt="" class="floatLeft"/> I also work for a photographer and in the job I get to manage all the events. Usually these events are parties, religious ceremonies, weddings. I coordinate everyone’s job and I can also host these events. I really enjoy my job because I get to work with my brother and one of my close friends. </p>
	  <p>Working was one of the things in life I was actually really excited for. I started off working for a family friend. We have known them for over 6 years and they come to our house at least once a week. I do want to apply for a job outside of this one but I am not sure exactly where. I know I do want to work in the food industry.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
